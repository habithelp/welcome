Lifetime License Clarification
If You have purchased a “lifetime” license for the Application, this license grants You the right to use the Application only in its current form and functionality as of the date of purchase.
The term “lifetime” refers solely to the period during which the Service is made available and does not guarantee perpetual access. The Company reserves the right to modify, discontinue, or terminate the Service, in whole or in part, at any time and without prior notice.
A lifetime license does not entitle You to future updates, additional features, ongoing server availability, maintenance, or support beyond what is currently offered. If the Service is discontinued, Your license will automatically terminate, and You acknowledge that no refunds or compensation will be provided for any unused portion of the lifetime license.
