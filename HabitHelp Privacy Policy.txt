The data controller is the natural or legal person who determines, alone or jointly with others, the purposes and means of processing personal data.
2) Contacting us
When you contact us (for example, via a contact form or by email), personal data is collected. The specific data collected through a contact form can be seen directly in the relevant form within the App. This data is used and stored solely for the purpose of responding to your inquiry, contacting you, and carrying out the necessary technical administration.
The legal basis for processing this data is our legitimate interest in responding to your request in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. If your inquiry is related to entering into a contract, the legal basis is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.
Your data will be deleted once your request has been fully processed, provided that there are no statutory retention obligations requiring further storage.

Where required for contract fulfillment, personal data will be shared with the transport company responsible for delivery. Payment data is transmitted to the relevant financial institution as part of the payment process, insofar as this is necessary to complete the transaction.

The legal basis for this data transfer is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.

4) Rights of data subjects
4.1
Under applicable data protection law, you are entitled to the following rights with regard to the processing of your personal data:
* Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR):
You have the right to obtain information about whether and how your personal data is processed, including the purposes of processing, categories of data, recipients, storage periods, your rights to rectification, deletion, restriction or objection, the right to lodge a complaint, the origin of the data (if not collected from you), and information about automated decision-making, including profiling, where applicable.
* Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR):
You have the right to request the immediate correction of inaccurate personal data and the completion of incomplete data.
* Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR):
You may request the deletion of your personal data where the conditions set out in Article 17(1) GDPR are met. This right does not apply where processing is necessary, in particular, to comply with legal obligations, exercise freedom of expression and information, serve the public interest, or establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.
* Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR):
You have the right to request a restriction of processing if you contest the accuracy of your data, object to unlawful processing instead of requesting deletion, require the data for legal claims after we no longer need it, or have objected to processing pending the verification of overriding legitimate grounds.
* Right to notification (Art. 19 GDPR):
If you exercise your rights to rectification, erasure, or restriction, we are required to inform all recipients to whom your personal data has been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. You have the right to be informed about these recipients.
* Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR):
You have the right to receive the personal data you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, or to request its transfer to another controller, where technically feasible.
* Right to withdraw consent (Art. 7(3) GDPR):
You may withdraw any consent you have given at any time with effect for the future. Upon withdrawal, the relevant data will be deleted unless further processing is justified by another legal basis. Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out prior to the withdrawal.
* Right to lodge a complaint (Art. 77 GDPR):
If you believe that your personal data is being processed in violation of the GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the Member State of your residence, workplace, or the location of the alleged infringement.
4.2 Right to object
If we process your personal data on the basis of a balancing of interests, you have the right to object to this processing at any time for reasons arising from your particular situation, with effect for the future.
If you object, we will cease processing the affected data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or if the processing serves the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims.
If your personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object to such processing at any time. Upon exercising this right, your personal data will no longer be processed for direct marketing purposes.
