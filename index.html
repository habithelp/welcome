        <h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
        <h3>1) Information on the collection of personal data and details of the data controller</h3>
        <p>Thank you for using our application (hereinafter referred to as the "App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we process personal data when you use the App. Personal data refers to any information that can be used to identify you personally.</p>
        <p>The data controller responsible for processing personal data within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is:</p>
        <p>Jakub Cichy<br>Hipolita Cegielskiego 14<br>52-130 Wrocław<br>Poland<br>Email: habithelp@gmail.com</p>
        <p>The data controller is the natural or legal person who determines, alone or jointly with others, the purposes and means of processing personal data.</p>

        <h3>2) Contacting us</h3>
        <p>When you contact us (for example, via a contact form or by email), personal data is collected. The specific data collected through a contact form can be seen directly in the relevant form within the App. This data is used and stored solely for the purpose of responding to your inquiry, contacting you, and carrying out the necessary technical administration.</p>
        <p>The legal basis for processing this data is our legitimate interest in responding to your request in accordance with Article 6(1)(f) GDPR. If your inquiry is related to entering into a contract, the legal basis is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. Your data will be deleted once your request has been fully processed, provided that there are no statutory retention obligations requiring further storage.</p>

        <h3>3) Data processing for contract fulfillment</h3>
        <p>To process contracts concluded through the App, we cooperate with service providers who support us, in whole or in part, in fulfilling these contracts. Personal data is shared with these service providers only to the extent necessary, as described below.</p>
        <p>Where required for contract fulfillment, personal data will be shared with the transport company responsible for delivery. Payment data is transmitted to the relevant financial institution as part of the payment process, insofar as this is necessary to complete the transaction. If external payment service providers are used, this is explicitly stated below. The legal basis for this data transfer is Article 6(1)(b) GDPR.</p>
        <p><strong>RevenueCat and Firebase Crashlytics</strong><br>For in-app purchases, payments are processed via RevenueCat Inc., 300 Euclid Avenue, San Francisco, CA 94118, USA. The information you provide during the purchase process, along with details of your order, is transmitted to RevenueCat exclusively for the purpose of payment processing and only to the extent necessary, in accordance with Article 6(1)(b) GDPR. We have entered into a data processing agreement with RevenueCat Inc., obligating the provider to protect users' data and not to disclose it to third parties. More information on RevenueCat's data protection practices can be found at: <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy">https://www.revenuecat.com/privacy</a>.</p>
        <p>To improve the stability and reliability of the App, we use Firebase Crashlytics, a service provided by Google Ireland Ltd., Google Building Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland. This service generates anonymous crash reports. In the event of an app crash, anonymous information is transmitted to Google servers only with your explicit consent, pursuant to Article 6(1)(a) GDPR. The transmitted information may include the app's state at the time of the crash, installation UUID, crash trace, device manufacturer, operating system, and the last log messages. Data may also be transferred to Google LLC in the United States. This information does not contain personal data. You can grant or withdraw your consent at any time via the App's settings by enabling or disabling the "Crash Reporting" feature. Further information on Firebase Crashlytics and data protection is available at: <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy">https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy</a>.</p>

        <h3>4) Rights of data subjects</h3>
        <p>Under applicable data protection law, you are entitled to the following rights with regard to the processing of your personal data:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Right of access (Art. 15 GDPR):</strong> You have the right to obtain information about whether and how your personal data is processed, including the purposes of processing, categories of data, recipients, storage periods, your rights to rectification, deletion, restriction or objection, the right to lodge a complaint, the origin of the data (if not collected from you), and information about automated decision-making, including profiling, where applicable.</li>
          <li><strong>Right to rectification (Art. 16 GDPR):</strong> You have the right to request the immediate correction of inaccurate personal data and the completion of incomplete data.</li>
          <li><strong>Right to erasure (Art. 17 GDPR):</strong> You may request the deletion of your personal data where the conditions set out in Article 17(1) GDPR are met. This right does not apply where processing is necessary, in particular, to comply with legal obligations, exercise freedom of expression and information, serve the public interest, or establish, exercise, or defend legal claims.</li>
          <li><strong>Right to restriction of processing (Art. 18 GDPR):</strong> You have the right to request a restriction of processing if you contest the accuracy of your data, object to unlawful processing instead of requesting deletion, require the data for legal claims after we no longer need it, or have objected to processing pending the verification of overriding legitimate grounds.</li>
          <li><strong>Right to notification (Art. 19 GDPR):</strong> If you exercise your rights to rectification, erasure, or restriction, we are required to inform all recipients to whom your personal data has been disclosed, unless this proves impossible or involves disproportionate effort. You have the right to be informed about these recipients.</li>
          <li><strong>Right to data portability (Art. 20 GDPR):</strong> You have the right to receive the personal data you have provided to us in a structured, commonly used, and machine-readable format, or to request its transfer to another controller, where technically feasible.</li>
          <li><strong>Right to withdraw consent (Art. 7(3) GDPR):</strong> You may withdraw any consent you have given at any time with effect for the future. Upon withdrawal, the relevant data will be deleted unless further processing is justified by another legal basis. Withdrawal does not affect the lawfulness of processing carried out prior to the withdrawal.</li>
          <li><strong>Right to lodge a complaint (Art. 77 GDPR):</strong> If you believe that your personal data is being processed in violation of the GDPR, you have the right to lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority, particularly in the Member State of your residence, workplace, or the location of the alleged infringement.</li>
        </ul>
        <p><strong>Right to object:</strong> If we process your personal data on the basis of a balancing of interests, you have the right to object to this processing at any time for reasons arising from your particular situation, with effect for the future. If you object, we will cease processing the affected data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for processing that override your interests, rights, and freedoms, or if the processing serves the establishment, exercise, or defense of legal claims. If your personal data is processed for direct marketing purposes, you have the right to object to such processing at any time. Upon exercising this right, your personal data will no longer be processed for direct marketing purposes.</p>

The term "lifetime" refers solely to the period during which the Service is made available and does not guarantee perpetual access.

        <h3>Limitation of Liability</h3>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the total liability of the Company and its suppliers under these Terms shall be limited to the amount actually paid by you through the Service, or USD 100 if you have not made any purchases. In no event shall the Company or its suppliers be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages, including but not limited to loss of profits, loss of data, business interruption, personal injury, or loss of privacy arising from or related to the use of or inability to use the Service, third-party software or hardware used with the Service, or any other matter connected with these Terms, even if the Company or its suppliers were advised of the possibility of such damages. Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on implied warranties or the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages. In such cases, the above limitations may not apply, and liability will be limited to the maximum extent permitted by law.</p>

        <h3>"AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" Disclaimer</h3>
        <p>The Service is provided to you on an "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" basis, with all faults and without warranties of any kind. To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Company disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied, statutory, or otherwise, including implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title, and non-infringement, as well as warranties arising from course of dealing, performance, usage, or trade practice. The Company does not warrant that the Service will meet your requirements, achieve intended results, be compatible with other systems, operate without interruption, meet performance or reliability standards, or be free of errors or defects, nor that any defects will be corrected.

        <h3>European Union Users</h3>

        <h3>Severability</h3>
        <p>If any provision of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, that provision shall be modified to best achieve its intended purpose to the extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions shall remain in full force and effect.</p>

        <h3>Waiver</h3>
        <p>Failure by either party to enforce any right or obligation under these Terms shall not constitute a waiver of that right or obligation. A waiver of any breach shall not be deemed a waiver of any subsequent breach.</p>

        <h3>Changes to These Terms</h3>
        <p>The Company reserves the right to amend or replace these Terms at its sole discretion. If changes are material, reasonable efforts will be made to provide at least 30 days' notice before the new Terms take effect.
